Algorithm

1. Take two vectors boys and girls as input arguments.
2. Sort both vectors.
3. Initialize variables boysIndex, girlsIndex, and pairs to track indices and count of pairs respectively.
4. iterate through both vectors simultaneously and find pairs.
5. Increment pairs if the absolute difference between current elements of both vectors is less than or equal to 1.
6. Increment boysIndex and girlsIndex accordingly.
7. after all, print the result.
